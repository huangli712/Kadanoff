    KadanoffBaym

The `KadanoffBaym` package is a state-of-the-art computational framework
for simulating the non-equilibrium strongly correlated electron systems.
It provides some useful application programming interfaces to manipulate
the non-equilibrium Green's functions defined on the ùêø-shape Kadanoff-Baym
contour, including:

* Basic integration and differentiation rules
* Basic operations for Contour Green's functions
* Basic diagrammatic algorithms based on many-body perturbation theory
* Solve Volterra integral equations
* Solve Volterra integro-differential equations
* Convolution between two contour Green's functions

This package is inspired by the `NESSi` (The Non-Equilibrium Systems
Simulation package) code, which was developed and maintained by Martin
Eckstein *et al*. Actually, it can be regarded as a replacement of the
`NESSi` package for those peoples who don't like or aren't familiar
with `C++`.
